A naive method for determining whether two documents are similar is to treat them as collections of words (bag of words) and use the number of words they share as a proxy for their similarity. It makes sense that two books with religion as the topic (e.g.  `398.txt` and `3296.txt`) would have more words in common than a book that discusses religion and a book that discusses science fiction (e.g. books `84.txt` and `398.txt`). \n",

This is because of how a book could be have a bunch of similar words but overall is about an entirely different subject. There are many common words that can be used and found with the different books. This is also proven by the fact that book 398 and book 3296 are both books about religon and share a total of 1790 common words, but book 84 shares 1681 common words with book 398.
